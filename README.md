WinSpot lets you easily create a WiFi hotspot with Windows 10 and earlier.
You don't have to know any console commands, WinSpot will do everything for you!

### Features:

* Very easy to use - just provide your network SSID (name) and a PSK (password).
* Working internet connection not REQUIRED, but recommended if you actually want to use the hotspot for something useful.
* Tiny package size.
* No installation required - this file works anywhere!

---

### Requirements:

* Windows - any new version (Win 7+) will work.
* A Wireless Adapter which is able to host a network - obviously.

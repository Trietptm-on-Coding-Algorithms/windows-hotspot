Lets you easily create a wireless hotspot with Windows 10 and earlier.
You don't have to know any console commands, WinSpot will do everything for you!

---

### Features:

* Very easy to use - just provide your network SSID (name) and a PSK (password).
* No working internet connection not REQUIRED, but highly recommended as I don't see why you would need a hotspot without a working network connection.
* Tiny package.
* No installation required - mobile!

---

### Requirements:

* Windows - any new version (Win 7+) will work.
* A Wireless Adapter, which is able to host a network - obviously.
